# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew Hoehn!

I'm a marketing strategist at a small agency where I focus on using data to help clients reach their goals. Whether it’s analyzing competitors, understanding industry trends, or uncovering customer insights, I believe you can't make smart decisions without good data. Sometimes, I run into problems and make small tools that gather information from the web. If I think they're worth sharing, I'll share them here. 
## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here
Most of my projects are geared toward **data gathering and analysis** – little utilities that help pull insights from the digital world. As I create tools that might be helpful for others, I'll share them here with you!

## 🎒 A Little About Me
Outside of marketing, I’m a dad to five  kids, a husband to a medical professional, and an enthusiastic (though slow) mountain biker, and a general enjoyer of the outdoors.
